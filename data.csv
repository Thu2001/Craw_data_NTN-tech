SMC Booster Regulator VBA,"Can increase factory air by a maximum of 200%, Power supply not requiredIt is possible to get a maximum of double the existing pressure by connecting the air to a factory line.(VBA11A: maximum 4 times)Space-saving type that directly connects air tanks and booster regulators Specification  The IN air passes through the check valve to booster chambers A and B. Meanwhile, air is supplied to drive chamber B via the governor andthe switching valve. Then, the air pressure from drive chamber B and booster chamber A are applied to the piston, boosting the air in boosterchamber B. As the piston travels, the boosted air is pushed via the check valve to the OUT side. When the piston reaches to the end, the pistoncauses the switching valve to switch, so that drive chamber B is in the exhaust state and drive chamber A is in the supply state respectively.Then, the piston reverses its movement, this time, the pressures from booster chamber B and drive chamber A boosts the air in boosterchamber A and sends it to the OUT side. The process described above is repeated to continuously supply highly pressurized air from the IN tothe OUT side. The governor establishes the outlet pressure by knob operation and pressure adjustment in the drive chamber by feeding back theoutlet pressure.

Improvement of buildup of cutting workpiece ejected. Improvement of resin moulding cutout workpiece ejected (1)Plastic ball vibrator has body made of plastic and is excellent in corrosion resistance. The vibration principle is easy, in which a steel ball rotates at high speed to generate powerful vibration. Because this ball vibrator with the simple principle and structure can be used easily, it is helpful for an area where minor vibration is required or for preventing clogging in hopper or chute. (During operation, it is necessary to supply lubricant with an oiler.)(2)UP-A series is a successor to the conventional UP series, for which the previous design is remodeled, and all the installation dimensions are the same. The vibration force is also almost the same, which maintains compatibility.(3)UP1 series include models UP110A and UP113A, UP2 series include models UP219A, UP3 series include models UP335A, which total 4 models (Successor to the conventional UP4 series is dropped from production.)(4)Model UP-S series is a new product. As compared to the same model as the model UP-A (Example: comparison between UP113A and UP113S), the amplitude is nearly double the value, which is a small powerful type. There are 2 models available: models UP113S and UP219S. A steel ball that rotates at high speed inside the housing with compressed air generates strong centrifugal vibration.Simply operating the pressure of compressed air allows frequency and centrifugal force to be easily changed.※ Use a lubricator (Oiler) to maintain its performance. Since the body is made of reinforced plastic, it has excellent corrosion resistance and is suitable for use in high humidity environments where rust is likely to occur. The smallest UP110A with the mounting width of 31 mm and the weight of 0.24 kg enables installation in narrow spaces where it is difficult to install a conventional vibrator. Ball can be replaced in all models.Replacement maintenance can be easily conducted by loosening bolts on the side cover, removing the side cover, and the replacing the ball.(Note: If the internal raceway ring is significantly worn, only replacing the ball will not repair the product) Although the ball vibrator is generally used to prevent minor clogging of powder in hopper or chute, it can be utilized as a motor for vibration table used for filling.Applications are expanded on various ideas, such as applying the vibration to eliminate buildup in parts supply line of production lines. All models of ball vibrator are provided with mounting holes for the fall prevention wire.It is highly recommended to mount the wire to ensure the safety in plant. (Wire is optional) Model UP-S is a powerful type with large amplitude.This series generates about double the amplitude compared to the UP-A series. As a result, the ability is used in an environment where large equipment installation spaces are insufficient while requiring powerful vibrations. CA1 type is a control panel for the manual pneumatic vibrator, which provides easy operation for the pneumatic vibrator and ball vibrator, and piston vibrator.Preparing only air tube and pressure air allows quick operation.

EXEN BH CH UH Series Ball vibrator,"Compact pneumatic vibrator in a wide range of models and expanded applications This product is used for the following applications: 01Milling plant: installation to small screening machine made by user 02Prevention of blockage in sodium chloride conveyance chute 03Improvement of buildup of workpiece ejected in screw production line. Improvement of buildup of cutting workpiece ejected. Improvement of resin moulding cutout workpiece ejected Ball vibrator is a compact vibrator that generates powerful centrifugal force vibration via high-speed rotation of steel ball by compressed air. This vibrator has simple principle and structure and can be used easily. It is generally used for preventing clogging in hopper chute, but the applications are expanded depending on ideas. Frequency and centrifugal force can be freely changed only by operation of air pressure. Depending on the on-site installation conditions, selection can be made from model lineup of BH-A, CH-A, and UH-A, which are different in positions of air supply and exhaust. (Supplying lubricant with an oiler is required) A steel ball that rotates at high speed inside the housing with compressed air generates strong centrifugal vibration. Simply operating the pressure of compressed air allows frequency and centrifugal force to be easily changed. ※ Use a lubricator (Oiler) to maintain its performance. The smallest BH8 with the mounting width of 18 mm and the weight of 0.3 kg enables installation in narrow spaces where it is difficult to install a conventional vibrator. (BH8 type can be installed in two directions.) Depending on the on-site installation conditions, selection can be made from model lineup of BH-A, CH-A, and UH-A, which are different in positions of air supply and exhaust. This series can be also used in water because of its high airtightness. (Assuming that exhaust pipe is extended to the atmosphere) Since the intake direction differs depending on the model, it is possible to select the model according to the piping restrictions of the air tube. BH type that can be installed with a single bolt is also available. The waterproof structure of this series enables use in watery environments. By attaching a tube connector to the exhaust port (replace the silencer with a tube connector) and extending the intake and exhaust hoses, this vibrator can be attached to an underwater object. (Note: If the exhaust tube is extended, the vibration efficiency will decrease.) Ball can be replaced in all models. Replacement maintenance can be easily conducted by loosening bolts on the side cover, removing the side cover, and the replacing the ball. (Note: If the internal raceway ring is significantly worn, only replacing the ball will not repair the product) Although the ball vibrator is generally used to prevent minor clogging of powder in hopper or chute, it can be utilized as a motor for vibration table used for filling.

NTN Deep Groove Ball Bearings,"Deep groove, or single row radial, ball bearings are the most widely used bearings in all general industries. They utilize an uninterrupted raceway that makes them optimal for radial loads. NTN radial ball bearings typically come with pressed steel cages, but also offer machined brass or molded nylon material. NTN also offers bearings with locating snap rings on the outside diameter. Pre-lubricated bearings have integral seals, or shields, and are packed with long-life grease. In many applications, these bearings can be used without supplementary seals, closures, or protective devices. Shielded ball bearings are protected on one or both sides by metal shields that are fastened to the outer ring. This close clearance shield retains the lubricant and helps prevent the entrance of large, foreign matter. Sealed ball bearings incorporate steel-reinforced rubber seals that are securely fastened to a groove on the outer ring. Contact with the inner ring provides positive sealing at all times. We also offer a variety of contact, light-contact, and non-contact seals to help you to dial in your protection while balancing your speed and torque requirements. With the heightened performance of today’s machinery, bearings are being used at higher loads and speeds. As a result, the industries using this machinery demand bearings with longer-lasting, compact designs, at lighter weights and lower costs. When manufacturing these bearings, stringent industry requirements must be met without changing the configuration of the related parts. At NTN, we’ve met these challenges by manufacturing the Thermal Mechanical Ball Bearing (TMB). NTN TMB Bearings feature: Clean, vacuum-degassed, high-carbon chromium steel that undergoes a proprietary heat treatment to reduce crack sensitivity. High-power density that allows a smaller bearing to support higher loads. A wide range of sizes. NTN TMB Bearings are available with all the features of a standard bearing—seals, shields, and clearances—so be sure to ask for them when looking for replacement parts.

Full of functions for higher design efficiencyCompact body allows easy replacement. World’s smallest class of compact body *1 This high-capacity yet compact Power Supply requires only less than half the space of the existing models.Side-by-side mounting possible. Our shared Value Design for Panel concept for the specifi cations of products used in control panels will create new value to our customer’s control panels.Combining multiple products that share the Value Design concept will further increase the value provided to control panels. The peak current (150% to the rated current) solves the issue of momentary surge of current to motor load. Motor-driven devices such as electric cylinders carry maximal instantaneous current when they start.When the maximum current exceeds the rated current of a power supply without Boost Current Function, overload protection is activated to limit the output current. To avoid this, you must select a power supply with a rated output larger than the maximum current.For example, if the maximum current exceeds 10 A, as in the figure on the below, you need a power supply with a rated output of 20 A.S8VK-WA is equipped with a Boost Current Function that allows a peak current (150% of rated output) to flow for 10 seconds, which ensures a stable startup by a power supply with a rated output current of 10 A as described in the figure on the below. S8VK-WA solves maintenance issuesSupport for efficient maintenance and quick rec overy from errors. Have you ever had these issues in maintaining power supplies? The equipment stopped and no output from the power supply. Disconnecting cables and inspection with a tester is required to identify the cause, taking time and work. Problems ・The cause is not clear.・The failure cannot be reproduced.・The problem recurs even after the power supply is replaced. Built-in maintenance point indicator indicates where to start S8VK-WA shows you the source of the problem (e.g. input/output side of the Power Supply, or the main body),without disconnecting cables or using a tester. LED and signal output indicates the status of the Power Supply. When the door of the control panel is closed, you can still check the status of the Power Supply via your controller, etc.,using the signal that is output in synchronization with the LEDThis feature clarifies the error status and necessary maintenance, minimizing the downtime.

NV Series Mitsubishi Earth-Leakage Circuit Breakers,"Earth leakage circuit breaker:ELCB is a molded case circuit breaker used in a low voltage AC circuit to provide electrical shock protection and prevent fires from leakage current.As a general abbreviation, ELCB in our model name is denoted as “NV”. Specification ELCB is defined as a “device with integrated ground fault detector, tripping device and switch mechanism in an insulated body, and automatically shuts off the electric current in the event of a ground fault”.  Even with the inverter circuit with digital filter circuit, a part with the sensitivity current as a general circuit can be selected.   A DPDC surge discriminating circuit is incorporated. It is judged as a ground fault and the circuit breaker functions only when the ground fault current polarity alternates with the positive/negative poles for a set time. Thus, the circuit breaker operates accurately without incorrectly tripping at a lightning surge, etc.  The type AC corresponds to typical alternating current leakage currents. In an electronic circuit such as an inverter or servo, it the rectifying circuit fails, an earth leakage current with a half-wave rectified waveform or a phase-controlled waveform might be generated. In this case, type A earth leakage protection characteristics are needed to detect the half-wave rectified or half-wave phase-controlled earth leakage current waveform.Then type A leakage protection characteristics is equipped with CE marked and UL489 listed ELCBs up to 250A. (except for NV30-CS)  With 2-3mA passing current, human starts to feel current, but not dangerous even when continued. With 5-30mA passing current, human has trouble breathing or blood pressure rises. Several minutes is the limit. Some 100mA-some A ground fault current causes arc ground fault. Finally it heats and causes the building materials to ignite fires.ELCB 15mA-30mA high speed type can protect electric shock accident. Also ELCB some 100mA can protect the fires.",,https://dl.mitsubishielectric.com/dl/fa/document/catalog/lvcb/yn-c-0720/y0720f2102.pdf,Earth-Leakage Circuit Breakers,,https://ntntech.vn/en/industrial-electrical-equipment/lv-distribution/earth-leakage-circuit-breakers/nv-series-mitsubishi-earth-leakage-circuit-breakers-2/
